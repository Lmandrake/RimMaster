# Freeze-review card rulings — owner, 2026-09-07

Rulings on the cards raised by `_freeze_review_2026-09-07.md`
(item `BIOME_FREEZE_FABLE_REVIEW_1`). **These are decisive canon.** Each ruling
below amends the docs named under it; amendments add detail, they never change
the ruling. Propagation status is tracked per ruling.

---

## R1 — THE SCALD IS A PERCHED OCEAN THAT SPILLS THE WORLD'S RIVERS

**Ruled:** the lore is the perched ocean. The Scald's surrounding mountains are
the water sources; the Scald is that water captured into a vast crater at
altitude; **its outflow makes the rivers that nourish the world.** Period.

🔑 **The map's −350 m is an ENGINE ARTIFACT, not a fact about the world.**
Owner, verbatim: *"Rimworld maps cannot handle the concept of an ocean that is
at altitude. They MUST be at 0 as defined. The map requires the scald be below
in order to be considered ocean, thus we draw it that way."* The world-def sea
table records how the Scald had to be **drawn**; it is not evidence of what the
Scald **is**.

⛔ **This reverses `the_scald.md`'s "terminal pan: eight rivers end in it, none
leave."** The eight rivers are inflow from the ringing mountains; the Scald
spills outward, and the dayside's great rivers are its outflow.

⚠️ **General principle this establishes, wider than the Scald:** a value read
off the painted map may be a *representation forced by the engine* rather than a
measurement of the world. `canon.yml` rule 1 ("a MEASUREMENT of the painted
world beats any prose about the painted world") does **not** apply where the
engine could not represent the truth — there the ruling stands and the map is
the compromise. Before citing a map-derived number against a lore claim, ask
whether RimWorld could have drawn the lore claim at all.

**Amends:** `the_scald.md` (§ sea table reading, terminal-pan framing),
`the_one_map.md` (its spill paragraph is CONFIRMED, not superseded), and the
water-source lines of every sheet that took its water from elsewhere because the
Scald was read as terminal.
**Opens:** the river-graph work — which rivers leave the Scald, their courses
and their fates (see the `RIVER_LEDGER_1` recommendation).

---

## R2 — RIVER ENDS: THE ABSOLUTE IS STRUCK, THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IS KEPT

**Ruled:** strike the absolute "EVERY river dies in a sealed salt plain."
Rivers end where they end. **Qualifier, ruled with it: even the Grey Sea has
begun the journey towards salt flat itself.** The salt end is the planet's
direction of travel, not a law that every river has already obeyed.

**Amends:** the world-def and `wasteland.md` (strike the absolute, write the
direction-of-travel qualifier), `the_grey_deep.md` (the Grey Sea is salting —
it is early on the same road, not exempt from it).
**Stands as written:** the Miasma's rivers-reach-the-Grey-Sea, the Greentide's
river graves, the Scald's inflow.

---

## R3 — GROWTH LAW: A PRINCIPLED EXEMPTION, NOT A LIST

**Ruled:** the freak-growth law (R-H3) applies only where **water AND light are
both present**. Where either is missing, growth is normal-to-dormant. This
derives all six contested sheets (terminator_sea, nightside_ice, wasteland,
arid_shrubland, dune_sea, deep_desert) automatically and rules every future
biome without a maintained list.

**Amends:** R-H2b — replace the terminator-seam sole-exemption wording with the
water-and-light test. Each of the six sheets cites the rule rather than
asserting slow growth bare.
**Owed:** a one-line call on the edge cases where "lit" is arguable (the Sump,
the Lantern Deeps, anything roofed or submerged).

---

## R4 — THE PLANETARY WIND: TWO OPPOSED HADLEY CELLS, MEETING IN THE STORMWALL

**Ruled, and this is the decisive statement of Ash'karr's atmospheric
circulation. Owner's words, 2026-09-07:**

- **Dayside:** the dominant signal is **inward radial at surface level toward
  the subsolar point, and outward radial at high altitude.** This closes at the
  terminator in the Stormwall turbulence.
- **Nightside:** it is **reversed** — the wind **sinks at the antisolar point**,
  blows **along the surface toward the terminator**, **rises in the Stormwall
  turbulence**, and **returns radially towards the antisolar point at high
  altitude.**
- These are the **planetary-scale Hadley cells, colliding violently against each
  other in the Stormwall** — producing the atmospheric volatile precipitates,
  the lightning, the ship damage and the rest of the terminator's weather.
- **The superrotating wind is a PERIODIC ADDITION to this overall flow, at
  altitude.** It is *"one of the reasons it's not just a bullseye world: it is a
  perturbation to the overall radial story."* It is not the planetary wind and
  never was.
- **At surface level, local variation in elevation, hydration and other factors
  can dominate with local weather patterns — the most extreme of which are the
  high mountain ranges.**

**Settles, in one ruling:**
- The two-wind-field conflict — `dune_sea.md`'s radial inflow is the surface
  law; `deep_desert.md` / `fall_line.md`'s superrotation is real but is an
  aloft, periodic perturbation, not the grain-cutting wind.
- **Circulation closure**, previously written three different ways: the dayside
  cell closes **at the Stormwall**; the nightside cell sinks **at the antisolar
  point** and also rises at the Stormwall. Both "stormwall" and "antistellar
  point" sheets were half-right; "ends at the crags" is wrong.
- **Pyrelands ash reaching the desert against the surface wind** — it rides the
  outward-radial high-altitude return, and the superrotation perturbation
  redistributes it off the bullseye.
- **The anti-bullseye question** — superrotation is the named mechanism that
  keeps the planet from being a clean radial bullseye. `deep_desert.md`'s "far
  ring" wording is legal in substance under this ruling.

**Amends:** `dune_sea.md`, `deep_desert.md`, `fall_line.md`,
`arid_shrubland.md` (stormwall sink), `terminator_sea.md` + `nightside_ice.md`
(antistellar sink), `desert.md` (ash route), and the world-def's weather
section, which should carry this model in full as the single cited source.

---

## R5 — FUEL: THE FINDING IS REJECTED. TWELVE SOURCES ARE EVIDENCE OF SCARCITY

**Ruled: there is no oversupply.** The review over-estimated **access and
availability**, not count. Owner, 2026-09-07: *"the fact that people have found
SO MANY ways to get fuel is still evidence of its scarcity."* A scarce resource
is exactly the one a population invents twelve marginal routes to.

🔑 **The gate is ACCESSIBILITY, and it is ruled per source.** No sheet loses its
economy; none of these is a major source save the Propane Lakes:

| source | why it is not a supply |
|---|---|
| **Propane Lakes** | the one real source — and **inaccessible until very late game**: terminator shock passage, extreme-cold safety |
| **Tar** | not fuel — must be **processed**, on machinery found only in some tar-containing squares (injected by *inhabited*), and it is **slow**; the player cannot stay long |
| **Sap-chemfuel** | not player-tappable — a **settlement-level investment** |
| **Seep oils** | slow seeps, hard to gather |
| **Tree liquors** | **fermentation-scale** production; not ship-friendly |
| **Blastpods** | wild; a minor input at best |
| **Tholins** | atmospheric **nanoparticles, unharvestable** — a similar keyword, not a fuel; contributes nothing to this story |
| **Venomvine** | becomes wood only over **timescales beyond the game** |
| **Glower / hydrocarbon flora** | harvestable, but slow and **very late game** |
| **Wick-plants** | sited in **one of the nastiest places on the map** |

⚠️ **And by the time the Propane Lakes are reachable, fuel scarcity SHOULD NOT be
the driving limiter** — the player is getting ready to win.

**Amends:** nothing is cut. Each sheet gains (or keeps) its accessibility clause;
`the_propane_lakes.md` keeps its premium, now explicitly a LATE-GAME premium.
**Doctrine this establishes:** before filing an oversupply finding, count
*reachable* supply, not sources. Twelve hard routes is scarcity.

---

## R6 — THE WATER TRUCE HOLDS WHERE THERE ARE OPEN SIGHTLINES

**Ruled:** the truce's mechanism is **distance you can see coming**. It holds on
open water where animals can watch each other and keep their spacing. In
enclosed water — slot canyons, walled cracks, roofed pools — there is no
distance to keep, so the truce **cannot** hold.

Derives `the_cracked_lands.md`'s 27 water tiles automatically, rules every
future enclosed water without a list, and makes the Cracked Lands the planet's
**one lethal water**.

**Amends:** the truce's statement in the world-def (add the sightline
mechanism); `the_cracked_lands.md` cites the rule instead of asserting a bare
exception.
**Owed at the roster pass:** which other biomes have enclosed water (the Sump,
the Lantern Deeps, canyon reaches of any river).

---

## R7 — THE PYRELANDS: THE FIRE IS THE SETTLEMENT BAN

**Ruled:** periodic burns destroy anything that cannot move — **no permanent
structures, no stored harvest, no walls.** Only **nomadic fire-followers** work
the Pyrelands, timing their circuit to the burn cycle. The richness stands
exactly as written; the scarcity premise is protected; the Pyrelands is a place
you **visit**, not settle.

**Amends:** `the_pyrelands.md` (state the ban and its mechanism), and the
settlement pass — **no permanent settlement may be sited in the Pyrelands.**

---

## R8 — DAYSIDE VAPOUR: "NEVER CONDENSES AS RAIN"

**Ruled:** the minimal amendment. `terminator_sea.md`'s sentence becomes
*"never condenses **as rain**"* — dew and fog are unaffected, and the Weeping
Stones / arid shrubland condensate economies stand.

**Amends:** `terminator_sea.md`, one sentence.
⚠️ **Deliberately left open:** WHERE dayside dew forms (open sand? stone? shade?)
is not ruled. The roster pass will have to answer it to site condensate flora.

---

## R9 — ⭐ WE DO NOT CROWN THINGS. DESCRIBE THE MECHANISM INSTEAD

**Ruled, and this is general doctrine, not an archive fix.** Owner, 2026-09-07:
*"We don't need any of these superlatives... We don't need to go around crowning
things for the planet."*

🔑 **The replacement is descriptive prose that states the MECHANISM and lets the
reader compare.** His own examples, as the pattern to write to:

- the cold preserver → *"acting like a deep record of all who fell here, so long
  as they survive the brutal dry freezing"*
- the tar → *"entombs all who fall into it, preserving their hard structures far
  into the future"*
- the Slime → **not "archive" at all**: *"living, flowing genetic database"* —
  which *"is more accurate than archive anyway."*

⛔ **This retires the whole SUPERLATIVE CROWNS card group** — the review's
finding #18 and its ten double/triple claims, #29's terminator "only"s, #13's
"the mod's fastest disease clock", #12's sickest-air trio, #15's wood monopoly,
#26's "only surface water", #20's "only seismically active province". **None of
them needs a crown ruling. Each needs its superlative rewritten as a
mechanism.** No sitting time is owed to deciding who wins; the work is prose.

**Amends:** every sheet carrying an "only / the planet's / the most / the
fastest" claim. The rule for the rewrite: say what the place DOES and why, and
never rank it against the rest of the planet.

---

## R10 — THE WILDSTEAM: THE GREENTIDE IS HOME, THE REST ARE HOLDINGS

**Ruled:** the Greentide is home ground and holds the **capital** — it already
carries two seats on the owner's own coordinates (Oilpalm and one more), the
strongest existing commitment. The others are demoted to holdings:

- **Sporefall** (Fever Wood) — the **beloved second city**, a stilt-built
  treetop town; a jewel, not the seat.
- **The Miasma seat** — the cool-weather retreat and first coastal foothold.
- **The Webwork seats** — the war front, ringing the Webwork's Scald side.

**Amends:** `the_greentide.md` (name the capital), `the_fever_wood.md` (Sporefall
is second city; its "home-canton preference" question for the Wednesday sitting
is now ANSWERED — remove it), `the_miasma.md`, `the_webwork.md`.
**Feeds:** the settlement pass, directly.

---

## R11 — THE WARDENS: ONE LIFECYCLE, A MIGRATION BETWEEN TWO BIOMES

**Ruled:** wardens **breed and are born in the Miasma's mangal nurseries**,
spend their **adult lives in the Grey Deep as the brine adults**, and **return to
the Miasma to die** — the elders too brine-broken to go back out become the
**warden mothers** guarding the next crèche.

Both sheets stand with one line each, and the planet gains a migration worth
more than either sheet alone.

**Amends:** `the_miasma.md` (the mothers are the END of the cycle, not the
species), `the_grey_deep.md` (its giant is paired against adults on their ocean
ground), and `sea_beasts_roster.md`.
**Owed:** a stated route between the Miasma delta and the Grey Deep.

---

## R12 — GEOTHERMAL: A DENSITY FIELD, NOT AN EXCLUSIVITY CLAIM

**Ruled: the question was never which province owns volcanism.** Owner,
2026-09-07: *"we should compute a density, a likelihood, of geothermal geysers
and other vents that decreases as you move away from mountain ranges on the
dayside and drops to zero on the terminator for sure. Just as a guide to prevent
the utterly random distribution currently observed... It's mostly about
preventing them from spawning on every map as they do now."*

**So the deliverable is a FIELD, not a sentence:**

- **likelihood is highest at/near dayside mountain ranges**, and **decays with
  distance** from them;
- **zero at the terminator**;
- it exists to stop geysers appearing on **every** map, which is the observed
  defect today.

⛔ **The Forge's "only seismically active province" is struck under [R9] anyway**
— it is a crown. The Forge is where the field is densest; it does not own the
mechanism.

**This is a BUILD item, not a prose amendment** — geysers are placed by RimWorld
mapgen per map, so honouring the field means constraining that placement.
**Amends:** `the_forge.md`, `the_scald.md`, and the Anvil seep lines, each to
cite the field rather than claim or deny exclusivity.

---

## R13 — THE POISON FOREST NEEDS NO HEAT SOURCE. THE "VENTS" ARE CHEMICAL

**Ruled: R12 stands with no exception carved for the terminator.** The collision
dissolves because the poison forest was never thermally dependent. Owner,
2026-09-07: *"You showed we didn't actually need the additional heat source, so
we don't need the geothermal here. It's all about the chemistry at the local
site, not anything heat-based. The venting was intended to describe flowing
complex chemistry, vapor formation, and powerful reactions anyway, not vulcanism
or thermal dependence."*

- ⛔ **Not geothermal.** The venting is **chemical** — flowing complex chemistry,
  vapour formation, powerful reactions. Nothing volcanic, nothing seismic.
- ⛔ **"The vents keep the ground just above freezing" is struck**, along with
  the freezing framing generally. The forest sits at the **canon terminator
  temperature** (+14 °C at θ90); it needed a heat source only because it had been
  written cold.
- ✅ Chemistry-as-energy-source, sunlight-as-scarce stands untouched — that was
  always the axis.

**Amends:** `poison_forest.md` throughout (its temperature block, its vent
language). It remains owed a full second pass — MEASURED block, weather table.

---

## R14 — THE PYRELANDS: FIRE HARVESTERS, NOT FIRE FARMERS

**Ruled (both option 3 and option 1 — there is no separate fire culture, AND the
contrast is the story):**

- ⛔ **There are no Pyrelands fire-farmers as a distinct people.** Owner: *"They
  are not 'farmers,' I have never liked that term."*
- ✅ **They are FIRE HARVESTERS** — and they are the **Deep Tribes**. They come
  into the Pyrelands **periodically, to perform their sacred Fire rites and reap
  its bounty**, then **return to their true homes in the deep desert**.
- 🔑 **The Pyre burns with or without them. It does not need them.** The
  relationship is harvest and rite, never husbandry.
- ⭐ **And their religion demands they swear off the old ways of high technology
  and water mastery.** That is a standing fact about the Deep Tribes, not a
  Pyrelands detail.

**Amends:** `the_pyrelands.md` (strike the farmer culture; the Deep Tribes visit
on a rite-circuit), `deep_desert.md` (the circuit, and the religious renunciation
of high technology and water mastery), and the faction docs.
**Confirms [R7]:** no permanent settlement in the Pyrelands — now with a named
people and a stated reason for the visit.

---

## R15 — THE FEVER WOOD: A SPORE FEVER FROM THE WOOD ITSELF

**Ruled:** the fever is **fungal — the wood's own spore load**, which is also
what Sporefall is named for and what the Wildsteam harvest there. The hazard and
the resource are the same thing, so living there is a bargain rather than an
accident.

**Amends:** `the_fever_wood.md` (state the disease, its clock, and the bargain).
⚠️ **Owed with it:** distinguish it clearly from the Miasma's and the Rot's
disease registers — three fungal/rot hazards must not read as one.
**Unblocks:** the Fever Wood disease roster, and [R10]'s Sporefall as second city.

---

## R16 — THE WEBWORK: THE SILK IS THE HAZARD

**Ruled:** the Webwork's air hazard is its own defining material — **shed silk
fibres and web dust suspended in the air and inhaled**: a mechanical, chronic
lung hazard, not an infection. It derives from what the biome already is and
distinguishes it cleanly from the Miasma's stagnation and the Greentide's rot.

**Amends:** `the_webwork.md` — replace the unsupported disease clock with the
silk mechanism.
**Owed:** a name and a clock for it.

---

## R17 — FLIERS CROSS BIOMES. THIS IS STANDING, AND HAS BEEN SAID MANY TIMES

**Ruled (owner, 2026-09-07, reaffirming):** *"there will certainly be fliers that
visit multiple biomes. We have made that clear many times."*

🔑 **A creature's roster entry in one sheet does not confine it to that sheet.**
Fliers — and migrants generally — range across biomes by design. A cross-biome
appearance is not a contradiction to be reconciled, and must not be filed as one.

**Closes outright:** the review's Cracked Lands flier-citation finding (#28) —
citing `desert.md` for a flier seen in the Cracked Lands is legitimate, not an
error, though the stronger support is `deep_desert.md` §4.
**Supports [R11]:** the warden migration is an instance of the same principle.
**Doctrine for reviewers:** before filing "this animal appears in two biomes",
check whether it can travel. If it can, there is no finding.

---

## R18 — RIVERS: THE LORE LEDGER FIRST, THE REPAINT AFTER

**Ruled:** both, in order.

1. **Author the lore river ledger now** — every river named, `source → course →
   fate`, built on [R1] (the Scald's outflow makes the rivers that nourish the
   world). This unblocks the assignment pass and the four sheets whose
   arithmetic depends on where water goes.
2. **Queue the repaint as a separate, verified build item** — once the ledger
   says exactly which rivers change direction on the painted map, redirect them
   from a finished spec rather than improvising on a frozen planet.

⚠️ **Until step 2 lands, the painted map and the lore disagree on river
direction at the Scald.** That is expected and is recorded here so a future
reviewer does not re-file it as a contradiction.

---

## R19 — ARC 40–50: MEASURE BEFORE RULING

**Ruled: do not rule the coverage gap blind.** `dune_sea.md` owns θ 0–40 and
`deep_desert.md` owns arc 50–69; read the world data for what biome defs
actually occupy arc 40–50 and how many tiles are involved, then rule with the
number in hand. The band may already be painted as one of the two, which decides
it for free.

---

## R20 — THE BLIZZARISK IS CUT FROM THE GAME

**Ruled, and this resolves the hyperweave violation by removal.** Owner,
2026-09-07: *"The blizzarisk is from the donor, not our canon. Remove it from
the game, it makes no sense here. Resolved."*

- ⛔ Not a rename, not a reclassification — a **cut**. It is a donor creature
  that was never ours.
- The Shokkweave sole-source ruling is therefore **unviolated**; nothing amends
  it.

**Amends:** `the_propane_lakes.md` §4/§7 — strike the Blizzarisk, its hyperweave
webs and 'hyperweave silk' from the exports. The Propane Lakes' value is the
propane (a late-game prize per [R5]); it has no luxury fibre harvest.
**Action owed:** a Cherry Picker cut of the donor def, not merely a prose
deletion — the sheet going quiet does not remove the animal from play.

---

## R21 — THE WEEPING STONES DO NOT GET RAIN

**Ruled:** `weeping_stones.md` §10b's "rare gentle rain" is a slip and is
**struck**. The Weeping Stones live on **condensate**, exactly as its own §6
says. Minimum surface area; the rain law is not rewritten.

**Amends:** `weeping_stones.md` §10b (strike), and **R-H4 — write in the
BlackRain carve-out that was ruled but never recorded in the rule.** R-H1 and
the rest of the rain law stand as written.

---

## R19a — ARC 40–50, MEASURED (the finding is mostly downgraded)

**MEASURED** from `world/ASHKARR_WORLDMAP_tiles.csv` (21,872 rows), 2026-09-07:
**1,328 tiles** lie in arc 40–50.

| tiles | biome def | sheet status |
|---:|---|---|
| 748 | `ExtremeDesert` | covered — dune sea + deep desert share this def |
| 203 | `Desert` | covered — `desert.md` |
| 97 | `RUT_TheScald` | covered — the Scald reaches out to arc 50 |
| 57 | `BiomeCypreJungle` | **no sheet** (on the item's undefined list) |
| 45 | `COMIGO_GreaterSwamp_Tropical` | **no sheet** |
| 42 | `AB_OcularForest` | **no sheet** |
| 39 | `AB_FeraliskInfestedJungle` | **no sheet** |
| 35 | `ZBiome_Grasslands` | **no sheet** |
| 17 | `ZBiome_DesertOasis` | **no sheet** |
| 16 | `Wasteland` · 12 `AB_MiasmicMangrove` · 10 `AridShrubland` | covered |

🔑 **The review's fall-through fear does not apply.** The roster binds **per
def, not per arc** — the 951 ExtremeDesert/Desert tiles inherit their rosters
whatever the sheets' arc prose says. The arc gap is a **prose** gap.
✅ **The real uncovered tiles in the band are the already-known undefined biome
defs**, which the item's blocked list already tracks. No new gap was found.

---

## R22 — EXTREMEDESERT: ONE MERGED ROSTER, STRICT INTERSECTION

**Ruled:** accept the def as the binding unit. `ExtremeDesert` gets **one
roster obeying BOTH sheets' bans** — the strict intersection `_assignment_prep.md`
already applies. No region split, no repaint, no new def.

Consequences, accepted deliberately:
- **bodySize 0.3–3.0 banned** across all `ExtremeDesert` — giants or
  grain-scale only.
- **No pursuit or ambush-from-cover predators** — subsurface strike only.
- The deep desert loses any animal the dune sea bans, **even ones written for
  it**. That is the price of the def binding, and it produces a genuinely alien
  fauna rather than a compromise one.
- The 748 arc 40–50 `ExtremeDesert` tiles take this roster automatically.

**Amends:** `_assignment_prep.md` §5 — the owner's first call is now ANSWERED;
strike the open question.

---

## R23 — THE SCARLANDS: WAR AEROSOL, NOT RAIN

**Ruled:** the Scarlands' toxic fall is a **legacy of the assailant weapons, not
weather** — aerosolised toxin still suspended over the province, settling out as
a corrosive fall when the air stills. It is **not rain**, needs no carve-out from
the rain law, and fits the biome's identity as a wounded place.

**Amends:** `the_scarlands.md` — replace ToxRain-as-weather with the aerosol.
**Owed:** a name that is not "rain", and a settling mechanism (when the air
stills — which [R4] now lets you site).

---

## R24 — GREENWOOD: A SLOW DRYING STEP

**Ruled:** green wood does not burn; **seasoned** wood does. The Greentide's
export is dried greenwood, and the drying is **long, space-hungry and
settlement-scale** — putting it exactly where [R5] puts every other fuel: real,
but never a supply a passing player taps.

**Amends:** `the_greentide.md` — the non-flammable-natives ban stands untouched;
the export gains its drying process.

---

## R25 — THE ASSAILANTS' AUTHORSHIP IS AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE EVERYWHERE

**Ruled:** the engineered-bioweapon origin is gated across the board. **The
player may INFER it; the player is never TOLD it.** Partition `the_rot.md`,
`the_slime.md` and `the_contagion.md` the way `the_scarlands.md` already is.

Keeps the discovery available as a late-campaign payoff instead of spending it
in a biome description.

**Amends:** the three sheets' prose partitioning. The Scarlands' existing ban is
the model.

---

## R24a — THE MIASMA/GREY SEA GEOMETRY GAP DOES NOT EXIST (measured)

**MEASURED** from `world/ASHKARR_WORLDMAP_tiles.csv`, 2026-09-07:

- `AB_MiasmicMangrove` — 92 tiles, **arc 18.9 – 75.0**
- `RUT_GreySea` — 381 tiles, **arc 70.0 – 105.5**

**They overlap at arc 70–75.** The Miasma's rivers reach the Grey Sea because the
two biomes physically touch. The review's flagged gap came from
`the_miasma.md`'s stated range (arc 24–66), which is simply **understated against
the paint**. No ruling owed.

**Amends:** `the_miasma.md` — correct its arc range to the measured span.

---

## R26 — THE ASH-CHURN TAR IS MADE UPSTREAM, NOT IN THE PYRELANDS

**Ruled:** tar is **not made in the Pyrelands**. Ash is carried out of the burn
province — [R4]'s outward-radial high-altitude return is the route — and churned
into tar **where there IS water**: downstream, and in the wetter uplands.

Resolves R-H9 against the measured Pyrelands (rain 0 on 207/226 tiles, 9 river
tiles) without inventing floods the map does not have, and creates a real
cross-biome flow.

**Amends:** R-H9 (the making moves upstream), `the_pyrelands.md` (it exports ash,
not tar), and the receiving sheets — which must now name where the churning
happens.
**Owed:** site the churn ground. The Sump's tar pits are the obvious receiver
(*"entombs all who fall into it, preserving their hard structures far into the
future"* — owner, 2026-09-07), but the route has not been drawn.

---

## R27 — THE NIGHTSIDE'S DIRTY ICE IS DEPOSITION, NOT PRECIPITATION

**Ruled:** the returning high-altitude flow carries dust and ice crystals from
the Stormwall and **sheds them as it sinks over the antisolar point.** That is
settling out, not snowfall — so `nightside_ice.md`'s no-precipitation ban stands
**untouched**, and the ice's dirtiness is explained: it is carrying the
dayside's dust.

Derives directly from [R4]'s nightside cell, which did not exist when the sheet
was written.

**Amends:** `nightside_ice.md` — write the deposition mechanism, and never as
weather.

---

## R28 — PROPAGATION: MECHANICAL NOW, DESIGN-BEARING AT THE SITTING

**Ruled:** split the wave.

- **NOW (agent, unsupervised):** [R9]'s crown-stripping across every sheet,
  [R20]'s Blizzarisk removal, [R21]'s struck sentence, [R8]'s one-word fix,
  [R19a] and [R24a]'s arc corrections.
- **AT THE WEDNESDAY SITTING (with the owner):** the rulings that need
  judgement — [R1]'s re-plumbing, [R14]'s Fire Harvesters, [R15]'s spore fever,
  [R16]'s silk hazard, and the rest.

Wednesday opens on clean sheets and spends its time on the interesting half.

---

## R18a — HOW RIVER DIRECTION ACTUALLY WORKS (engine fact, read 2026-09-07)

⛔ **"Reverse the river links" is a NO-OP and must not be attempted.** Read from
the RimWorld source, not inferred:

- `WorldGrid.OverlayRiver` writes the link **symmetrically** — `fromTile` gets a
  `RiverLink` to `toTile` **and** `toTile` gets one back to `fromTile`. A river
  edge stores **no direction at all**. Swapping the a/b columns of a links row
  changes nothing.
- Direction lives in **`SurfaceTile.riverDist`**, one `int` per tile (saved to the
  world as the byte array `tileRiverDistances`). `OverlayRiver`'s last line:
  `toTile.riverDist = Max(toTile.riverDist, fromTile.riverDist + 1)`.
- `WorldGenStep_Rivers` seeds its flood-fill from **coastal Ocean tiles** and
  extends upstream, so **riverDist counts hops from the MOUTH: 0 at the mouth,
  increasing upstream.**
- Map generation reads it back — `TileMutatorWorker_River`,
  `_RiverConfluence`, `_RiverIsland` all order the tile's links by the
  neighbour's `riverDist`. **The neighbour with the LOWER riverDist is
  downstream.**

🔑 **So the real repaint spec for [R18] step 2 is: renumber `riverDist` along the
five Scald rivers so the Scald end holds the MAXIMUM, not the minimum.** No
elevation change is needed, and no link is edited. This also means [R1] costs the
map nothing — the Scald can stay at −350 m and still be the source.

⚠️ **UNMEASURED, and it needs the live game:** `riverDist` is not in
`ASHKARR_WORLDMAP_tiles.csv`, so we do not know what values the frozen world
actually holds — our rivers were applied by `world/_rivers/apply.py`, which may
never have set it. Read it live before planning any write. Also unconfirmed:
whether the bridge exposes `riverDist` for writing at all.
⚠️ `riverDist` is stored as a **byte** — a river longer than 255 hops cannot be
numbered.

## R29 — FUNGALFOREST MERGE: FOLLOW THE PAINT

**Ruled:** the per-tile neighbour analysis wins over the cluster-spec table in
`FUNGALFOREST_RAID_MERGE_1.md`. The 16 **South Crags sector 9** tiles go to
**BiomeGRimond (Blue Desert)** / **AB_RockyCrags (Forsaken Crags)** — whichever
actually surrounds each — **not** to Wasteland.

🔑 **The principle: a merged tile must be continuous with its new biome.** That
is what a merge is. A 16-tile Wasteland enclave with no Wasteland adjacent to it
would read as an error to anyone who opened the map later.

⛔ **Supersedes** the cluster-spec table in the item file — mark it superseded
there rather than deleting it.
✅ **Also settles the 15 flagged ties** by the same rule: majority adjacent
biome, broken by closest temp/rain match. No separate ruling owed.

**MEASURED merge result** (425 tiles, `BMT_FungalForest`, arc 74.0–132.9):

| tiles | receiving biome |
|---:|---|
| 352 | `AB_MycoticJungle` — the Rot |
| 53 | `Desert` |
| 8 | `BiomeGRimond` — the Blue Desert |
| 8 | `AB_RockyCrags` — the Forsaken Crags |
| 4 | `RUT_NightsideIce` |

Zero unreachable or all-water-bounded tiles.

## R30 — THE ROT GROWS; THE SHEET IS AMENDED TO MATCH

**Ruled:** absorbing the 352 tiles pushes `AB_MycoticJungle`'s arc footprint from
the sheet's stated **89–130** to the measured **75.3–132.9**. Amend
`the_rot.md` to the new footprint. The Rot really is that big; taking those tiles
is what dissolving `BMT_FungalForest` *means*.

This is the freeze working as designed — **an amendment adds detail, it never
changes a ruling.**

⚠️ **Owed with it:** the Rot's dayward edge now sits in warmer ground than the
sheet's climate prose assumes. Check its temperature line against the new arc
before the assignment pass.
⚠️ **Compounds:** the 53 tiles going to `Desert` land on top of the already-open
`WORLDMAP_DESERT_BAND_REPAIR_1` climate-outlier defect. Repair before painting,
or the outliers grow.

## R31 — ALL FIVE SCALD RIVERS FLOW OUT. ELEVATION IS NOT AN ARGUMENT

**Ruled.** Owner, 2026-09-07, correcting BENCH a second time on the same point:
*"Remember: the fact the scald is low is an artifact of the limitation of
Rimworld, NOT the world itself. So please have the rivers flow as we're saying,
and then simply adapt the map the best Rimworld can handle, ok?"*

- **R02, R03, R05, R06, R12 all become OUTFLOW** from the Scald.
- ⛔ **Do not argue from `elev_m` against a lore direction.** The −350 m floor and
  every upstream height are consequences of [R1]'s rendering constraint. "R12
  would have to climb 1587 m" is not an objection; it is the artifact talking.
- The ring-mountain **inflow is not currently drawn as rivers**, and does not
  need to be — the Cratercrown sheds into the crater whether or not the engine
  draws a link.
- 🔑 **Method: author the lore truth, then adapt the map to whatever RimWorld can
  hold.** Not the reverse.

⚠️ **BENCH note against repetition:** this is the second time an elevation
reading was allowed to argue against [R1] in one day. The rule is written at
[R1] and again here; a third occurrence is a process failure, not an oversight.

---

## R32 — PROVE `riverDist` FIRST, AND EXPECT A SAVE→RELOAD

**Ruled: session order is prove-then-work.** Before any bulk edit, read
`riverDist` live with `jawa/world_links_get`, then clear and re-lay ONE short
river (**R06**, 10 tiles) with `jawa/world_links_clear` + `jawa/world_links_set`
and read it back.

Why it is first: `OverlayRiver` sets `riverDist = Max(existing, previous + 1)`,
so the value **never decreases**. If `world_links_clear` does not reset it, a
clear-and-relay reports success and silently keeps the old direction — the
classic bridge silent failure.

⚠️ **Owner, 2026-09-07:** *"you may need to Save→Reload the game file in order to
see changes (very common in Rimworld)."* **A read-back that still shows the old
value is therefore NOT proof of failure until a save/reload has been tried.**
Budget the reload into the test rather than concluding from the first read.

---

## R33 — RIVER NAMES: BENCH DRAFTS, THE OWNER EDITS

**Ruled:** BENCH drafts all 16 names from the vocabulary the biome sheets and
world regions already use; the owner accepts, edits or rejects line by line.
Working IDs R01–R16 retire the moment the list is ruled.

---

## R34 — SETTLEMENT REJIGGER: RELEASED, BUT ITS OWN SESSION

**Ruled:** `SETTLEMENT_REJIGGER_ROUND2_1` moves off `needs: owner` (now
`needs: bridge`) so it stops being invisible, but it is **not folded into the
worldmap write session.** Settlement placement is a looking-and-judging pass
deserving the map in front of the owner, and it depends on [R10] (the Greentide
capital, Sporefall as second city) and [R7]/[R14] (no permanent settlement in the
Pyrelands) — rulings the sheets have not absorbed until the Wednesday sitting.

---

## R35 — R01 DRAINS THE SPINE'S OUTER FLANK

**Ruled:** R01 (**The Long Green**, 102 tiles — the planet's largest river) drains
the **OUTER face of the Cratercrown**: the same ring of mountains, the same rain,
the slope that faces away from the crater. It is the Scald's water without being
the Scald's outflow.

- ✅ **[R1] holds with no map surgery and no exception.** No links are added.
- 🔑 It also explains why R01 is the biggest: it takes the whole outer catchment.
- ⭐ **The Cratercrown is the planet's true water engine** — the crater and the
  outer flank are two faces of one mountain ring. "Nourish the world" is about
  the Spine as much as the Scald.

**Amends:** `the_scald.md` and `the_one_map.md` — name the Spine as the
catchment; the outer flank is R01's source.

---

## R36 — SAFETY STANDARD FOR WRITING TO THE FROZEN WORLD

**Ruled, and it is the bar for calling ANY of this done:**

1. **Back up the savegame first.**
2. **Apply in batches**, never one giant write.
3. **After each batch, read back with a GETTER** — `world_tile_get`,
   `world_links_get`, `world_mutators_get`. ⛔ **Never trust the write's return
   value.**
4. **Re-export the tiles CSV and DIFF it against the committed one** — confirming
   not only that the intended tiles changed, but that **nothing else did.**

🔑 **Step 4 is the one that catches the failure a per-def check cannot see:** a
scoped check reads 100% while other work is silently destroyed. Diff the LOSSES,
not just the gains.

---

## R37 — THE SCALD SOURCES ITS RIVERS AT THE SHORE

**Ruled:** `RUT_TheScald` keeps `allowRivers: false`. Instead, **the first LAND
tile adjacent to the Scald is each river's SOURCE** — it carries the highest
`riverDist`, and riverDist **decreases outward** to the far mouth.

On screen the river emerges from the Scald's edge and runs away from it, which is
how a lake outflow actually looks; drawing a river ribbon across a large water
body looks wrong, and both vanilla `Lake` and `Ocean` set the flag false too.

✅ **No def change, no redeploy.** [R1] reads correctly in game at zero cost.

### measured state that made this decision
- `jawa/world_links_get` on tile 19369 (a Scald tile): biome `Lake`,
  `allowRivers: false`, **`hiddenByBiome: true`** — the link is already invisible.
- The live world paints 19369 as `Lake` while the CSV says `RUT_TheScald`: the
  world is behind the CSV, which the import fixes.

---

## R38 — 🔴 `riverDist` ON THE FROZEN WORLD IS NOISE, NOT A DIRECTION

**MEASURED 2026-09-07** via `jawa/world_links_get` on R06's ten tiles, in
graph order from the Scald: **`0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, …`** — cycling, never
increasing from any mouth. `world/_rivers/apply.py` laid the segments in
arbitrary order and `OverlayRiver`'s `Max()` preserved whatever came first.

🔑 **So the river job is NOT a reversal. There is no direction to reverse — we are
establishing one for the first time.** Lower risk than [R32] assumed, and the
`clear-then-relay` question is moot for correctness: any full re-lay in mouth-first
order improves on noise.

⭐ **Supporting evidence for [R1], found in the paint itself:** R06 carries
`River` at its Scald end and degrades to `Creek` outward — exactly the gradient a
river losing water to evaporation as it leaves a large source would have. The
existing paint already tells the outflow story.

---

## R39 — TILE 16869: THE COLONY GOES, AND A FRESH ONE IS MADE BEFORE SAVING

**Ruled.** Owner, 2026-09-07: *"Do it, but then make a NEW colony map somewhere
before we save with one colonist so that we can boot normally from it later."*

- ✅ Import with `--despite-map`; the colony on 16869 is not preserved.
- 🔴 **Before the save, create a fresh colony map with one colonist** so the
  savegame boots normally later.

**Confirmed call sequence** (the owner asked for this to be confirmed before
proceeding): `jawa/tile_settleable` → `jawa/colony_found`
(`SettleUtility.AddNewHome`; does NOT make the map) → `jawa/world_tile_map_generate`
(`GetOrGenerateMapUtility.GetOrGenerateMap`) → `jawa/spawn_pawn`
(`faction: player, count: 1`).

⛔ **The trap that governs it — `TILEGEN_SILENT_REUSE_1`:**
`world_tile_map_generate` **fabricates success on the SECOND distinct-tile call
per session** — `success: true, wasAlreadyGenerated: false`, the same `mapIndex`
as call 1, and `mapCount` does not rise. **Make exactly ONE generate call, and
verify with a `rimworld/get_game_info` `mapCount` before/after delta — never from
the tool's own return value.**
⚠️ Also check whether the broken map left on 16869 still exists as a Map object
after the import; a dead map may stop the save booting cleanly, which is the whole
point of this ruling.
