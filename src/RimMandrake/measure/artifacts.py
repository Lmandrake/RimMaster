"""What each large artifact IS, and which instrument may speak about it.

One registry, read by two consumers that must never disagree:

  * the Measurement library (option D) — to refuse a question it cannot judge
  * the PreToolUse hook (option E) — to refuse a byte scan before the wrong
    number exists

Keeping them on one table is the point. A hook that refuses `grep` while naming
an instrument that does not answer the question is worse than no hook.

⚠️ Scope is EVERY large scanned artifact — owner, 2026-08-21. Not the def dump
alone. For the two we do not own — the `.rws` and third-party DLLs — no format
change is ever possible, so the answer there is D + E only: a correct reader,
and a hook that says so.
