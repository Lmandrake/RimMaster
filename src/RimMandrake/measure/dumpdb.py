"""The def dump as SQLite — option C of SCANNED_ARTIFACTS_CANNOT_LIE_1.

Why SQLite and not JSONL (owner's choice, 2026-08-21): `NULL`, `0` and "no row"
are three different things without anyone maintaining a convention, and a count
is one number that costs no parsing and no context. The price, accepted openly,
is that the dump stops being diffable and greppable.

⚠️ **Both formats are written for one capture cycle.** This module never deletes
the JSON. `verify_against_json()` re-reads the source and checks it row for row;
the JSON stops being written only when they have agreed on a real capture. A
format migration that is also a trust migration is not a single step.

The schema exists to make the failures that happened IMPOSSIBLE rather than
unlikely:

  * `capture.coverage` is a tri-state per def type, so a type the dump never
    wrote reads `absent`, not `0`. That is the 824-def loss.
  * `def_tags` is a real table, so tag -> weapon -> cut-status is a join rather
    than an index rebuilt by hand. That is what weapon_tag_audit got wrong.
  * `provenance` carries the mod-set fingerprint, so an answer says which world
    it is an answer about.

Reading a 331 MB single-line JSON file: json.load would build the whole object
graph at once. Instead raw_decode walks the `defs` array one element at a time,
so peak memory is the file's text plus one def.
