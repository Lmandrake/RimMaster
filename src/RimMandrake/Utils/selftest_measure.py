"""Selftest for the measure package — SCANNED_ARTIFACTS_CANNOT_LIE_1.

⭐ WHY THIS TEST EXISTS AT ALL. The rule the whole item rests on is
*"validate the instrument against a case whose answer you already know."*
An instrument that enforces that rule for everyone else and is not itself
validated is the joke writing itself. So this file asks questions whose answers
were established by hand, and fails if the new path returns a plausible wrong
number — which is precisely what the seven old instruments did.

The cases fall into two halves:

  * **synthetic** — a tiny DefDump built in a temp dir, holding a deliberate
    filename collision. These run anywhere, with no game and no live dump.
  * **live** — asked of the real defs.sqlite if one exists, and SKIPPED with a
    line saying so if it does not. A skip is not a pass and is not printed as one.
